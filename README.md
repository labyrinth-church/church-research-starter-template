## Introduction

This moment in the 2015 movie Spotlight always moved me. [Phil J Saviano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Saviano), founder of [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests|SNAP]] storms into the Boston Globe offices with a box full of evidence. The box is worn -- he's been hauling it around for years, trying to get someone, anyone to believe him about what he can see plain as day in front of him.

He is harried and has given his spiel to people who don't believe him or don't care for years.

I was in journalism school 1999-2003 -- at a university where child-rape survivors are still mocked from the podium by powerful law professors -- and from what I know about research and the state of journalism and culture at that time I admire Mr. Saviano's bravery deeply. He had spent years putting together the few news articles he could find, digging for obscure legal documents, listening to the pain of others. And no one believed him until suddenly they could do nothing but believe him. This is how truth wins against lies. It is like the crest of a wave -- it has entire oceans to traverse before it comes crashing ashore and then no one can deny it. 

So take heart, friend.  If you are here you might be very hurt and scared. I am hurt and scared, too. But we will make the biggest of waves together.

## Chasing Ghosts

Those of us who have been abused by churches know the tactics they use well. We know about the [mobbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing), the gas-lighting, the slanders when you are absent to discredit you, the threats they will utter to you and assure you no one will believe they made. The shocking acts of violence whose ripples only seem to affect us.

But I will give you a huge lead, right off the bat: you are not uncovering a conspiracy. Disabuse yourself of that notion right away; it will only lead you astray.  It did not just happen to you, it did not just happen in that singular cloistered place where they trapped us when we were children.  You are uncovering a culture. You are discovering how a group of people act -- and how they have acted over and over and over and over and over again. And you will discover you are far from alone. This will somehow both comfort you and absolutely devastate you. 

If you go on this journey expect tears. Expect gnashing of teeth. Expect long sleepless nights. But know that that truth we seek is imminent and inevitable.
## It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take this.

This project is a notebook for a piece of software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

I have 25 years experience rooting around looking for what is true. When I discovered Obsidian I was both sad and relieved. Sad because someone had gotten to the software that was in my head first, relieved because I did not have to write it and I could let those frustrating prototypes rest for a while.

Obsidian has what they call Vaults, but I can't help but call them Notebooks. They are a collection of text files in a format called Markdown. To get very technical: Obsidian composes and organizes markdown files with YAML front matter. It has all sorts of plugins to help our research, and I have already installed a few in this notebook / vault.

I have laid it out with the best approximation of what we need to investigate the churches we come from. I might be wrong. Don't be scared to adjust it. 

## Data Hygiene and Mental Health

I will give you a warning from personal experience: working with these datasets can trigger massive PTSD responses. Please take care of yourself first. I recommend you download a specific browser / have a specific profile you use for research. If you don't do this Google search and other services will start recommending you articles and ads targeted to your trauma. These can hit at just the wrong time. It is important to compartmentalize your research for your own mental health. 

Don't be scared to archive this notebook and put it away for a while. I do this over and over again -- sometimes I can't bear to work on the datasets. This fight will not be one by any single one of us but by many of us finding our own tiny strengths and healing ourselves. 

The truth is patient, and will we waiting for us when we are strong enough to face it. **Take care of yourself first.**

# Getting Started

## Obsidian

First I recommend you download Obsidian.md and familiarize yourself with how it works. Their excellent tutorial can be found here: https://help.obsidian.md/Home.  You can also access their help document in Obsidian by typing **Ctrl-p** While you can edit this notebook with just a plain text editor of your choice, it is optimized to Obsidian

First, download this repository. You can do it by clicking the green button on the upper right of the [github project](https://github.com/labyrinth-church/church-research-starter-template) and clicking on "Download Zip". If you are familiar with git (which is brilliant software that is confounding to even the most experienced engineers) you can clone the repository. 

Then you can press the keys **Ctrl-P** on your keyboard and this will open up a context menu. Begin to type in the words "Open Another Vault". The option should appear in the menu. 

The context menu is going to become your best friend. It has all sorts of commands that will speed up our research. In this notebook I have installed a few helper applications. 

### Links

Obsidian helps us generate links between documents. The markup is quite simple -- it is two square bracket. The file doesn't need to exist for you to create the link. Check the Obsidian help documents for more information: https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links (either using the link above or pressing **ctrl-p** and then typing help). If a file exists it will appear in the search bar for the link. 

A more advanced user can start to use aliases (https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) to help weave the links into more natural sounding prose. 

### Templates


I have added some templates to this notebook. Templates give us a structure to our data with some defaults. To use a template go to the note you would like to change. You can do this by creating a link (as detailed above) or searching for a file using Ctrl-o to see if it exists, first. If the file does not exist it will give you the option of creating a new file. 

When you are in the file press Ctrl-p again and type templates. Select the option Insert Template

And then it will give you a list of templates to use: 

![[Pasted image 20240310080118.png]]

Select the appropriate template. Each template provides a metadata structure for our notes for later use. 

## Omnivore

The next tool we use is Omnivore. Omnivore lets us quickly grab news articles and sync them to Obsidian. 

First set up an omnivore account at [Omnivore.app](https://omnivore.app/) Install the plugin for your browser and login. 

For firefox the plugin can be found here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/omnivore
For Chrome it can be found here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/omnivore/blkggjdmcfjdbmmmlfcpplkchpeaiiab

Then go to settings in the Obsidian note book -- press **Ctrl-P**, then type **Open Settings**. Navigate to the bottom of the left panel. Click on Omnivore. Follow the link on the first line that says https://omnivore.app/settings/api . Create an API Key and then copy and paste it into the field. 

Now when you find a news article you find relevant you can click the Omnivore button on your plugins bar of your browser. If you navigate back to your

## WikiData

Wikidata provides what is called structured data. It gives us a ground-truth for organizations and some people. To search wikidata for an entity press ctrl-p again and type wikidata. Select wikidata and search for the entity. If you find it select it from the drop down. This will create a file in db. In the note you are in start to type the two square brackets

```
[[
```

and it should show you the latest file added to the project -- your wikidata link. 

## Wikipedia

To search wikipedia for a name press ctrl-p and type wikipedia. You can add wikipedia articles several ways. It often times gives an error. You can remedy this by searching Wikipedia on your browser and selecting the desired name of the entry from the text of the last entry. For instance, our hero Phil Saviano's wikipedia link looks like:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Saviano
```

We can make sure we are grabbing the right wikipedia entry by entering in 

```
Phil_Saviano
```

to our wikipedia search. 


# Conclusion

I hope this template is useful. I hope it helps spread truth and kindness in the world. 

Jesus used two metaphors that seem appropriate here: the metaphor of the yeast and the mustard seed. Tiny things that branch out and expand magnificently and beautifully. Here is my little seed, and I pray that it spreads justice and love. 

Please take care of yourselves first.
