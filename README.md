## Introduction

![Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tm8Y7wzogZo?si=i005SI0x0dMhhG7f)

This moment in the 2015 movie Spotlight always moved me. [Phil J Saviano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Saviano), founder of SNAP storms into the Boston Globe offices with a box full of evidence. The box is warn -- he's been hauling it around for years, trying to get someone, anyone to believe him about he can see plain as day in front of him.

He is harried, and has given his spiel to people who don't believe him or don't care for years.

I was in journalism school 1999-2003 -- at a university where child-rape survivors are still mocked from the podium by powerful law professors -- and from what I know about research and the state of journalism and culture at that time I admire Mr. Saviano deeply. He had spent years putting together the few news articles he could find, digging for obscure documents, listening to the pain of others. And no one believed him until suddenly they could do nothing but believe him. This is how truth wins against lies. It is like the crest of a wave -- it has entire oceans to traverse first, and then its inevitability breaks on the shore and you simply cannot deny it. 

So take heart, friend.  If you are here you might be very hurt and scared. I am hurt and scared, too. But we will make the biggest of waves together.

## Chasing Ghosts

Those of us who have been abused by churches know the tactics they use well. We know about the [mobbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing), the gas-lighting, the slanders when you are absent to discredit you, the threats they will utter to you and assure you no one will ever believe they gave to you. The shocking acts of violence whose ripples only seem to affect us.

But I will give you a huge lead, right off the bat: you are not uncovering a conspiracy. Disabuse yourself of that notion right away, it will only lead you astray.  It did not just happen to you, it did not just happen in that singular cloistered place where they trapped us when we were children.  You are uncovering a culture. You are discovering how a group of people act -- and how they have acted over and over and over and over and over again. And you will discover you are far from alone. This will somehow both comfort you and absolutely devastate you. 

Expect tears. Expect gnashing of teeth. Expect long sleepless nights. But know that that truth we seek is imminent and inevitable.
## It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take this.

This project is a notebook for a piece of software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

I have 25 years experience rooting around looking for what is true. When I discovered Obsidian I was both sad and relieved. Sad because someone had gotten to the software that was in my head first, relieved because I did not have to write it and I could let those frustrating prototypes rest for a while.

Obsidian has what they call Vaults, but I can't help but call them Notebooks. They are a collection of text files in a format called Markdown. To get very technical: Obsidian composes and organizes markdown files with YAML front matter. 

I have laid it out with the best approximation of what we need to investigate the churches we come from. I might be wrong. Don't be scared to adjust it. 

# Getting Started

## Obsidian

First I recommend you download Obsidian.md and familiarize yourself with how it works. Their excellent tutorial can be found here: https://help.obsidian.md/Home.  While you can edit this notebook with just a plain text editor of your choice, it is optimized to Obsidian

First, download this repository. You can do it by clicking the green button on the upper right. If you are familiar with git (which is brilliant software that is confounding to even the most experienced engineers) you can clone the repository. 

Then you can press the keys Ctrl-P on your keyboard and this will open up a context menu. Begin to type in the words "Open Another Vault". The option should appear in the menu. 

The context menu is going to become your best friend. It has all sorts of commands that will speed up our research. In this notebook I have installed a few helper applications. 

## Omnivore

The next tool we use is Omnivore. Omnivore lets us quickly grab news articles and sync them to Obsidian.
